## World of this game

### Story 

Garbage. It's a evil thing that human beings have produced. 
In the year 2,300, cities are filled with so much garbage that they are 
even 

falling from the sky. 
People's lives are hindered from trash and the towns are turned into war 
fields. 
Facing this serious situation, the Gorvenment formed a special task 
force for 

garbage collection. 
That special team is where you belong--Nakajima Garbage Cleaning! 
Your mission is to gather ever-increasing garbage to save the world! 

### How to play 
Tap on the garbages falling down from the sky. 
If you gather something else than a garbage, the game will be over. 

### Flushing sound 
A toilet is a place where one can be most relaxed. 
And that is the last place that youd expect a garbage attack! 
Let's take a break with this flushing-water sound device!
